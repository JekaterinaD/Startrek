<h2 align="left">About this project</h2>

###

<p align="left">This project is a web application designed for the fictional firm "Star Trek," facilitating the recording and management of employee orders. The application features two main components: employee data and order processing.<br><br>**Key Features:**<br><br>- **Employee Overview**: The welcome page displays all employees, sorted by first name. Clicking on an employee leads to their individual page.<br>- **Employee Page**: Each employee page includes a photo and options to view past orders or create a new order.<br>- **Orders Management**: <br>  - **Order History**: Lists all past orders for an employee, sorted by order number.<br>  - **New Order Creation**: Allows the entry of a new order, requiring mandatory fields for description and a positive number for the amount.<br>- **Order Processing Logic**: <br>  - If the employee's budget is sufficient (â‰¥ order amount), the order is processed, reducing the budget and adding the order to the database.<br>  - If the budget is insufficient (< order amount), an error message is displayed.<br>- **Concurrency Handling**: The application is designed to handle multiple clerks entering orders simultaneously, including for the same employee.<br><br>This application is an excellent demonstration of handling real-time data entry and processing in a web-based environment, showcasing skills in database management, backend processing, and possibly frontend design, depending on the technologies used.</p>
